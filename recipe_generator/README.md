# Welcome to my Recipe Generator App (ShelfChef)
Tired of trying to figure out what to cook with the ingredients you have at home? This app can solve that problem, by suggesting recipes you can create -- without
the need to go to the grocery store for additional ingredients!

# Functionality
The app contains the following features:
- Users can create a profile and login, as well as customize their avatar by inputting a URL to an image
- Users can save recipes by 'liking' them, which is then saved to their profile's 'Liked Recipes' page
- Users can and and remove ingredients that they have, with a searchbar that supports autofill (based on occurences of ingredient in all recipes)
- After searching for a recipe with an inputted list of ingredients, users are displayed the most relevant recipes (based on least number of missing ingredients 
  as well as number of 'likes' the recipe has), and are also given an infinite scroll feature that returns more recipes if desired
- Recipes can on initial list can be clicked to view all in depth instructions, with the capacity of liking a recipe to save it, or to unlike it as well

# Development Process
In a group of 4 practicing Agile/Scrum methodologies, we followed the process outlined below:
- Daily scrum meetings, with rotating scrum masters lasting 10-15 minutes, where we talked about what we've finished since the previous meeting, what we are working
  on now, and any obstacles
- Sprint planning (2 weeks) and breakdowns into user stories -- we also assigned story points through the use of Fibonacci and scrum poker
- Delegation of tasks through the use of a Jira board and an icebox (where we stored previosuly uncompleted items from past Sprints)
- Utilized thorough system and unit tests of each feature implemented to ensure correct functionality
